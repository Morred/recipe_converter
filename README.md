# Recipe Converter

This app adjusts the amount of ingredients for a recipe 
according to the number of people or the changed amount of 
one of the ingredients.

Useful if you have a recipe and want to cook for more/fewer
people or if you have less of one ingredients than you would
actually need. No need for recalculating every ingredient's 
amount one by one.
